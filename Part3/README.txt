CSCE 315-203
Project 2.3
Team 25 (H Team)


The files to compile and run for 2.3 are all right inside the Part 3 folder from the GitHub.

To compile in the compute.cse server, type "javac *.java" in the command line.

To run, then type "java DatabaseEngine" and it will run the main function in the DatabaseEngine.java file.

We have included some testing functions in our main function along with some data files.
